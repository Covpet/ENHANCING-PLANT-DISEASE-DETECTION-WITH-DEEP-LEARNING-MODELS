# ENHANCING-PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING-MODELS
## PROJECT TOPIC
ENHANCING PLANT DISEASE DETECTION WITH DEEP LEARNING MODELS: A CASE STUDY ON MAIZE AND CASSAVA SPECIES. 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project aims to develop a high-performance deep learning model for detecting diseases in maize and cassava crops. Leveraging an extensive image dataset and state-of-the-art architectures, the study seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease detection, ultimately benefiting agricultural productivity and sustainability.
